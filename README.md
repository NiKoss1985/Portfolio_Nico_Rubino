# [Project 1: K-means Segmentation for eCommerce](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj) 
* I imported machine learning library, pandas, numpy, matplotlib for visualisation. 
* I manipulated the dataframe and improved the readability to get a better understanding of it 
* I standardised the data 
* Found the natural clustering and applied visualisation techniques.   
* Built k-means clusters and assigned descriptive labels to the clusters

# [Project 2: Dataframe manipulation in Pandas](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
For this example project I applied manipulation techniques to a data frame. This could be useful for a Growth Marketing Manager working for EdTech Startup. I have worked on the following operations:
- Imported & downloaded .files in pandas
- Deleted & created, renamed columns
- GroupBy & Pivot Functions
- Create new columns as CTR, ROI, ROAS, CR% 
- Merged data frames

I was able to perform the most common and useful operations in marketing analytics before predicting performance in marketing for brands in pandas (Python).
