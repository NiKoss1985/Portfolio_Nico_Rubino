# [Project 1: Linear Regression, Students Performance](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
In this project, I applied regression and multi-regression analysis to an education database. The main goal was to predict what factors influence the student's performance with higher probability. I used the sklearn.model package and seaborn for visualisation. 

Here are the main steps of my work:
- Import in pandas the libraries and the file (.csv)
- Data exploration to find the first correlation  
- Perform the 'Test, Learn & Split' test to train the model 
- Analyse the data to find outliers
- Final comments

# [Project 2: K-means Segmentation for eCommerce](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj) 
* I imported machine learning library, pandas, numpy, matplotlib for visualisation. 
* I manipulated the dataframe and improved the readability to get a better understanding of it 
* I standardised the data 
* Found the natural clustering and applied visualisation techniques.   
* Built k-means clusters and assigned descriptive labels to the clusters 

I was able to perform the most common and useful operations in marketing analytics before predicting performance in marketing for brands in pandas (Python).
